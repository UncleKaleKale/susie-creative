        <h4>Subject Matter</h4>

          <p class="b"> Today we are working on "contour drawing" and "illusion drawing."
</p>
      </head>
        <body><h4>Student Work</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Find a photo of a relative.  See the outline of their face/head  (looking straight on, or a side profile, or an angled view.)  Draw the shape of their face/head in your art journal or on a clean, new sheet of art paper or computer paper.  Please note-you are not drawing their eyes, you are not filling in any of their features.  You are ONLY drawing the shape/contour of their face/head.   (Feel free to draw anything you want in your art journal that you see, please save this art journal for non-symbol drawing.)  Sign and date.  Write the name of the relative.  *****You may only wish to draw the contour of their face, you may only wish to draw the contour of their entire head and neck..  It's up to you; only, do not fill in any details.  This lesson is about contour and "seeing" the edge and drawing what you are actively SEEING, not at all from memory.</li>


            </ul>
          <h4>Student Activities</h4>
            Activities:

            <ul>
              <li>Do exercise 2 in the workbook.
              </li>
              <li>Watch the Betty Edwards Video for instruction and explanation.</li>

              <li>Do the "Vase Face" exercise.
            </li>
            <li>
              Begin the Upside-Down Drawing exercise to be completed in class next week.  Students will be given time to complete their pre-instruction portraits.
            </li>
Bonus:
            <li>Extra take-home or in-class upside down drawing, copy practice.</li>
          <li>Wanna do more?  Feel free. You can create a game with these face shapes for a holiday gathering, in which family members try to figure out who is who, by only having face-shapes.</li>
          <li>On a new sheet of paper (or new page in your journal), you can also create an expressly artistically enhanced piece of abstract-modern art with that very same face shape.  Please feel free to draw the same exact face shape that you drew originally, and this time use all kinds of shapes, outlining, doodles and more to enhance the shape of the face.</li>
           </ul>
